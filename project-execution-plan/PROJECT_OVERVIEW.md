# Visual Neurons Web App - Execution Plan & Progress Tracker

## üéØ Project Goals
- Build a FAANG-level web app for AI-powered image editing
- Implement a robust payment/credit system to prevent bankruptcy
- Create a modern, centralized CSS architecture
- Deliver exceptional user experience with proper error handling

## üìä Current Critical Issues
1. **No payment system** - Users have unlimited access to expensive AI APIs
2. **CSS scattered everywhere** - Violates core project guideline
3. **Poor code architecture** - Business logic in pages, not FAANG-level
4. **No error handling** - App crashes on API failures
5. **No usage tracking** - Can't monitor costs or user behavior

## üöÄ Execution Phases

### Phase 0: Critical Fixes (Immediate - 2-3 days)
**Goal:** Stop the bleeding and stabilize the application
- [x] **Implement emergency rate limiting** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - 10 operations/hour limit active
- [ ] Add basic error handling for AI operations
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring alerts
- [ ] Create temporary usage caps

### Phase 1: Payment & Credits System (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Implement full billing infrastructure
- [ ] Design and implement credit system data model
- [ ] Integrate Stripe payment processing
- [ ] Build credit management Lambda functions
- [ ] Create free tier with limits
- [ ] Add credit checking middleware

### Phase 2: CSS Architecture Overhaul (Week 3)
**Goal:** Centralize all styling per project guidelines
- [ ] Create comprehensive design system
- [ ] Implement CSS variables and utilities
- [ ] Remove all .module.css files
- [ ] Build component library with consistent styling
- [ ] Add dark mode support

### Phase 3: Code Architecture Refactor (Week 4-5)
**Goal:** Achieve FAANG-level code quality
- [ ] Extract all logic from pages to custom hooks
- [ ] Refactor AI provider architecture (eliminate code duplication)
- [ ] Implement proper state management (Context API)
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript types
- [ ] Create service layer abstractions
- [ ] Implement error boundaries

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancement (Week 6-7)
**Goal:** Create intuitive, professional user experience
- [ ] Build credit balance dashboard
- [ ] Create onboarding flow
- [ ] Add operation cost previews
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Design usage analytics page

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Week 8)
**Goal:** Ensure reliability and performance
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Add integration tests for payment flow
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and performance
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Completion Status
- Phase 0: 25% ‚úÖ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú (Emergency rate limiting completed)
- Phase 1: 0% ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
- Phase 2: 0% ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
- Phase 3: 0% ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
- Phase 4: 0% ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
- Phase 5: 0% ‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú

### Key Metrics to Track
- [x] **API costs per day** - Now protected with 10/hour rate limits ‚úÖ
- [ ] Average cost per user
- [ ] Credit purchase conversion rate
- [ ] Error rate reduction
- [ ] Page load time improvement

## üîç Success Criteria
1. **Zero unauthorized API usage** - All operations require credits
2. **Single source of styling truth** - No CSS in individual components
3. **<2% error rate** - Proper error handling throughout
4. **<3s page load time** - Optimized performance
5. **>80% code coverage** - Comprehensive testing

## üìù Notes
- Each phase has detailed tasks in its respective folder
- Update this document weekly with progress
- Review and adjust timelines based on actual progress
- Prioritize Phase 0 and 1 - they're business critical
